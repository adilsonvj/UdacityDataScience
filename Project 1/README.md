#Data Science Udacity Nanodegree 

## 1. Installations

### xgboost==1.3.3
### seaborn==0.11.0
### scikit-learn==0.23.2
### pandas==1.1.3
### numpy==1.19.2
### matplotlib==3.3.2
### autopep8==1.5.4


## 2. Project Motivation

This project is part of the Udacity data science nano degree, the goal of this project is to apply the data science
techniques over a dataset, answering some of the business questions using the CRISP framework.
This project was created over the Rio de Janeiro Airbnb listings of November 2020. Analyzing which features are more correlated
with the host experience and price.

In the end, some of the business questions that we want to answer in the end is:

### - Are the amenities important for the host experience? If yes, which amenities are the most? Are these amenities correlated with the price?

### - Is the host a fundamental factor for the host experience? If yes, what can a host do to improve their services?

### - Is the neighborhood important for the price? If yes, which one is the most expensive? Are they correlated with the users' experience?

### - Which feature influences more the price? And the review scores?

And you will find with (more details) that For the end, have a nice kitchen will certainly surprise the hosts and deliver a very good experience 
for them. Also the commitment of the host is something that can change everything, answer hosts' questions and as soon as possible. 
And finally, choose wisely the number of rooms, this will certainly influence the price. :)


## 3. File Descriptions
The datasets used here are only 2, the raw dataset of the listings, with the name of more_listings.csv, and a backup of the listings already 
preprocessed with the name of new_listings.csv. For the project itself was used the Airbnb_Udacity_Project_1.ipynb, which you can open and see
the analysis done.

## 4. How to Interact with your project
To interact with the code you will need to open the .ipynb file with an IDE of your preference, which can be Anaconda Jupyter Notebook or 
even the Visual Code Studio.
